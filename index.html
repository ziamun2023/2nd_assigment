                            projects, some architects may combine Design Development with 
                               Schematic Design, as sometimes some architects only make a 
                                hazy sketch, in schematics, while others start out the 
                                project on computer and stay on computer, as they feel 
                                that is a more efficient method and 
                                that nothing is wasted.  However, there is no precise 
                                right or wrong method.  Each 
                                architect has their own preferences about how they go 
                                about creating something from 
                                nothing.  Some architects produce only floor plans and

                         is added to the previous Schematic Design.Some architects add 
                          exterior building elevations at this point and perhaps a roof p 
                           lan.  Others may decide to include a building section.  
                            However, there is no specific right or wrong method.  Whatever 
                             works for each firm.  Additional dimensions are tested to 
                              insure that various items will fit into the proposed

                        Commercial Projects:
                        Depending on the scope of the project, this can become a very d 
                         etailed phase where equipment selection is made and tested to 
                          make sure it all fits within the building shell and  
                           arrangement.  Also, energy calculations may be made to test 
                            glass, insulation and other requirements to insure that the

                            believe they are essential. In general, the more information, 
                             the better, to minimize the chances of unknown conditions and 
                              pricing changes.

                        Commercial Projects:
